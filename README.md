# Data Visualization with Python
## Course Final Assignment

This is the Final Assignment for the course Data Visualization with Python, as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certification on Coursera, taught by Alex Aklson (Ph.D., Data Scientist / IBM Developer Skills Network).

Even though the report has not been requested, I took the chance to practice with it. As tool to perform the assigned tasks I have chosen a Jupyter Notebook with Python 3.6 kernel on IBM Watson Studio.
